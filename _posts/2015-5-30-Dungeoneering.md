This Unity app procedurally generates a dungeon layout of rooms and corridors. A set number of rooms sizes are generated at the world origin, these are then spaced out using iterations until no rooms overlaps exist. Adjacent rooms are joined with corridors. Geometry is generated for each tile. A UI for customizing this layout supports laying down new tiles using the left mouse button - drag lclick to place trails of tiles.
